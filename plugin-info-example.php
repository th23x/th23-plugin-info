Also lists can easily be created:

* Mail sending via **SMTP server** instead of default PHP mail function - and with custom subject prefix
* **Revision and edit restrictions** for posts and pages
* **Highlighting in titles** of posts and pages - for custom styling via theme
* ...

Even code style is in between `matching apostrophy`, which will work independet of the code language, eg also for CSS selectors like `.entry-title span`.

A favourite [search engine](https://duckduckgo.com) can serve as a link example.';
